This is data shared between all XBuilds in a whole project. A project is a collection of different versions
of a package and the XBuilds and metadata associated.
The maintainers contains a dev or group reference. Keep in mind that this MUST be present in the tree-wide
metadata. Check the tree-info folder out.
The name is 'the friendly name' for the package. It is the name that user typically refers to the package
with and will use on the command line. Names are for instance glibc, ncurses or perl. Only lower case is allowed.
In sdesc we put a one-line description of a package. Take note that you must specify language.
The ldesc is for long description of a package. Go nuts.
Keywords is where the package is to be found in the hierarchy. A keyword for firebird could be database or www.
In this case user will know the package as www:firebird or database:firebird.
