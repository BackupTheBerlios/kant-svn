<!-- Sanitized a wee bit. Killed phone attribute from office element. Use contactmethod instead. 
     Added a postaladd child to office for adding a post address.
	 Made contact an optional empty child of organization. It is just for special attn if needed.
	 Killed the timezone attribute from contact element. It's implied in office timezone.

<!-- A contact regarding the tree.
     email is a primary method of contact, so it gets an attribute
     timezone is for scheduling real-time discussions -->

<!-- timezone format should be a timezone identifier, followed by a UTC+xx:xx offset,
     optionally followed by a alternate timezone identifier, followed by an alternate UTC offset.
     If required, it will be followed by a series of switchover times (in UTC, of course)

     For example:

     GMT UTC+0 BST UTC+1
  
     (The alternate time zone takes effect later in the calendar year than the primary, so it is reversed for southern hemisphere)
